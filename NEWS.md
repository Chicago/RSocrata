### 1.1 
Add check for valid Socrata resource URL. Add check for supported download file format. Add support for Socrata short dates.

### 1.2 
Use comma-separated file format for Socrata downloads.

### 1.3 
* Added support for human-readable URL. Users can now copy and paste URLs of Socrata-hosted datasets, which will be transformed into a valid SoDA API web query. 

* Added additional RUnit tests to validate new functionality.

### 1.4 
Add json file format for Socrata downloads. Switch to `RJSONIO` from `rjson`. 

### 1.5 Several changes:

* Swapped to ```jsonlite``` from ```RJSONIO```
* Added handling for long and short dates
* Added unit test for reading private datasets

### 1.5.1 
Deprecated ```httr::guess_media()``` and implemented ```mime::guess_type()```

### 1.6.0 Several changes:

* New function, ```ls.socrata``` to list all datasets on a Socrata portal.
* New optional argument, ```app_token```, which lets users supply an API token while using ```read.socrata()``` to minimize throttling.
* Repairs a bug where ```read.socrata``` failed when reading in a date with a column, but there are null values in that column.
* Minor changes to the DESCRIPTION documentation to point users to GitHub for issues and provides new contact information.

### 1.6.1 Bug fixes:

* Resolved potential [name collision issue](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/42)
* Cleaned-up documentation with contributor instructions [#23](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/23) and [#28](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/28))
* Moved test coverage in `RUnit` to `testthat` and implemented code coverage monitoring ([#41](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/41))
* Clean-up DESCRIPTION ([#40](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/40))
* Add continuous integration for Windows ([#39](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/39))
* Migrate Travis-CI to "proper" R YAML ([#46](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/46))

### 1.7.0 Several changes

New features:
* Users can upload data with `write.socrata()` to upload data to Socrata data portals (using "upsert" and "replace" methods).
* Download private datasets by using Socrata credentials with `email` and `password` fields in `read.socrata()`.

Bug fixes:
* Updated unit testing on `ls.socrata()` to check for `@type` field is available.
* Converts a Socrata money field into a proper numeric field, instead of a factor.
* Updated build method for Travis to test using the current CRAN packages, not beta packages from GitHub.

### 1.7.1 Bug fixes:

* Users provided an option to handle string-like fields as characters (chr) or factors. Default is to handle string-like fields as character vectors ([#27](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/27))
* Fixes bug where dates are incorrectly read when first date is a blank ([#68](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/68))
* Dates are now handled using `POSIXct` instead of `POSIXlt` ([#8](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/8))
* Added additional unit testing ([#28](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/68))
* Artifacts from Appveyor CI can now be directly submitted to CRAN ([#77](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/77))
* Fixed issue where JSON may occasionally come back with a final NULL that is not "[]" (in this example it was "[]\n").  This caused `getDataFrame` to get stuckin an infinite loop while waiting for "[]".  Thank you @kevinsmgov for documenting this bug in issue ([#96](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/96))
* Resolved an error users would see when downloading the JSON file on a SoDA call, `Error in rbind(deparse.level, ...) : numbers of columns of arguments do not match`. ([#19](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/19))
* The LIMIT argument was incorrectly interpreted by RSocrata, which sometime causes slower performance ([#83](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/83), [#14](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/14))
* The mandatory `@context`, `@id`, `conformsTo`, and `describedBy` fields were not shown when using `ls.socrata()`. These elements are now included as attributes in the resulting data frame. ([#72](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/72))
* Fixed a bug which a user-defined token was ignored when the user passed along a `$where` argument in a SoDA query. ([#105](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/105))
* Fixes a bug where the POSIX date conversion would not occur when using the JSON SoDA url (#85)
* Queries now follow SoDA guidelines and are explicitly sorted. This could have caused a silent error where some row may not have downloaded. ([#15](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/15))

### 1.7.2 Several changes:

Performance improvements:

* By default, 1000 rows at a time were being retreived for each API call while paging through data. Increased to retreive 50,000 rows for each API call. ([#129](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/129))

Bug fixes:

* Fixed a bug which caused an error if a ```select=count()``` statement was present in a URL. ([#120](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/120))
* Fixed a bug when data types are not found because there are no ```X-SODA2-*``` headers available in the API response. Users will now get a warning and data will be returned as ```character```. ([#118](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/118))
* Fixed a bug which did not recognize URLs listed from ```ls.socrata()``` as valid URLs to be used in ```read.socrata()```. Users will now be able to use URLs from the former function in the latter function. ([#124](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/124))
* Removed unit tests for older releases of R. ([#136](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/136)) 

Deprecation:

RSocrata's core development team has stated a formal policy to only support the most recent release of R. Until now, RSocrata was tested against the penultimate release of R; however, testing will be limited to the current version of R and the current development release. The project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) have been updated to reflect that accepted changes to RSocrata must pass tests on the current and penulimate versions of R.

While RSocrata is only tested on the current and penultimate version, the core development team expects it will work on older versions most of the time. See [#132](https://github.com/Chicago/RSocrata/issues/132) for more information.
